```{r cars}
datatable(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplotly(ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point())
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
